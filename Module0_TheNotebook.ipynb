    "Python is a fun language to learn, and really easy to pick up even if you are new to programming.

Python is high level programming language, targeted at students and professionals from diverse backgrounds.\n",

    "This set of examples are in Python 3, written and executed in the beautifully simple IDE Jupyter Notebook. As Notebooks are rendered in the browser as web applications, they can support a wide range of frontend elements, including cells (code and markdown), graphics, animation and interactivity. Note that Jupyter initializes a local server running python at the backend (on your own computer), and renders the frontend through a Notebook environment at `localhost:8888`. Keep the backend server (generally runs on your terminal for Linux/Mac or Anaconda Prompt for Windows) running so that the frontend notebook interface can access Python. \n",
